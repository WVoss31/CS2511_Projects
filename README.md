# CS2511_Projects
This repository is the entire collection of all of the projects I have completed in CS2511 Software Analysis and Design

# Things to keep in mind:

This class *required* the use of Netbeans 12.0 (at least that's what I used, I think). I later switched to newer versions, and it seemed to work, but functionality is not guaranteed with any other IDE or version. (A classmate of mine struggled with Intellej and I had issues with VS Code with Java extensions)

 Labs are shorter and easier assignments, wheras Assignments are usually much longer and more complicated.

 I have tried to utilize branches to show off how each project built on the last, however, some have no correlation (Circles lab/assignment and Threads lab).

 The most recent and fully featured project will be commited to the main branch, and earlier versions will be seperate branches.

The commit messages and branch names might be messed up, due to me creating, commiting, and pushing each project to its own repository, however, in the interest of clarity, and for organization for future projects, I decided to put it all into one repo.

To run the program, right click on various test files, and click `test file`. The files that you should click on will be in each branches README.
